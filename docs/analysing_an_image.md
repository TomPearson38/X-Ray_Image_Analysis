# Analysing An Image for Flaws

Once you have trained an AI, you are able to use it to analyse images for flaws.

**Starting Image Analysis**

1. Select an image to be analysed by clicking the browse button. Choose an image to be analysed in the file browser. Ensure the image is in "jpg" or "png" format.

2. Select an AI model to be used to analyse the image from the list of available AI models that have been trained.

3. Click the analyse button to begin the image analysis.

**Viewing results**

When the analysis has concluded, a window displaying the results will appear.

- At the top of the result window, a label displays the AI's conclusions. Either "No Fault Detected" or "Fault Detected"

- If faults have been detected, they will be annotated on the image and displayed on a list to the right.

**Adding the Image to the Dataset**

You have the opportunity to add the analysed image to the dataset. If the AI analysis was incorrect, it should be added to the dataset. 

1. Select the "AI Was Incorrect" button.

2. The AI annotations will now appear in blue on the image. If you would like to add or delete annotations, do this as normal, as you do when adding a new image.

3. Once you are happy with the changes, press save changes.

4. The image will now be located in the All Images dataset config and can be added to other configs like normal.
